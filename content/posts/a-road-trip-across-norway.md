This happened a few weeks ago, but I've been lazy. 

## The back story

For years now me and some friends have been good friends with a bunch of Swedes. We met 5 or 6 years ago playing PUBG, and have visited each other many times.

This year we planned on going to New York, but the plans fizzled out. For a while they were planning on visiting the UK, but that also went nowhere. I got a text from one of the Swedes at 06:30 one morning saying "Phone me", which scared the crap out of me as I assumed something was wrong. Fortunately, nothing was wrong, he just wanted to propose a trip to Norway.

So, myself, a fellow Brit and two Swedes embarked on a cross-country road trip from Oslo to Bergen and back. During this trip I saw some of the most incredible scenery in my life. At one point, I was unsure if what I was seeing was even real, as the view was simply unimaginable.

## Day 1

The two Swedes drove from central Sweden over to Oslo, and picked me and the other Brit up from the airport. We drove into central Oslo and checked into a somewhat pleasant hostel. We checked in, dropped out bags off and headed out in search of some food. We found a local burrito place about 50 meters from the hostel.

We spent the remainder of that day exploring the city, which was surpisingly quiet. Oslo was only a jumping off point for the main event, which was the road trip. So we didn't spend a huge amount of time there. It had a similar feeling to Stockholm, just with less people and more electric cars. Later on that day, we stopped off at a street food market, which also appeared to be a nightclub for some reason. After we ate, we stumbled into an escape room place, and played a game where we were stuck in a submarine and had one hour to escape before being trapped underwater forever. It was super fun, but very easy.

For the last couple of years, we've found that one of the best ways to explore a city is with Voi scooters (if they have them.) They allow you to ride around the city with ease and take everything in. We spent that evening exploring as the sun was setting. After that, we headed back to the hotel and had an early night.

## Day 2

We got up quite early, and set off for our drive across Norway. There were three main routes we could take, and we settled on the northern most route as we hoped it would have some better views.

The journey would have taken about 7 hours if we drove non-stop, but we had plenty of time. All in all I think it took around 10 hours or so, as we stopped frequently to explore and rest. 

Or first stop was just on the side of a road to stretch our legs, but it was still very nice looking.

The second stop happened at around 1250 meters high. We stopped at a place where people had stacked rocks on top of each other. I'm sure this place has a name, but I don't know what it is. At this elevation the temperature had dropped significantly, and it was really windy. We didn't contribute to the rock formations, but it was fun to see how creative people had got.

The next stop was at some crazy dam, bridge thing. Some people were running back and forth along it, through the wind and the rain.

The next stop was in some massive canyon, filled with waterfalls. At the stop of the canyon was a hiking outpost, filled with travellers drinking coffee and huddling around a fire. It was weird to see people trying to warm themselves up in the middle of July! The views were absolutely incredible here.

After several hours more driving we ended up in Bergen. I think we grabbed some food, but I can't remember. We checked into our hotel and crashed.

## Day 3

We took this day as an opportunity to explore Bergen itself. It's a large (for Norway) fishing town on the far west coast. There's a huge fish market amd lots of cool viking looking buildings.

We were looking for somewhere cool to eat, and found a viking themed restaurant in the port. Not the most friendly place for vegeterians, and the only options for me were to order several starters as a main, but it's to be expected at a place like that. All the other guys ate like kings, one person even ate whale!

Afterwards we went to a sports bar, played some pool and other games, before getting an early night ahead of the main attraction.

## Day 4

This day was the day where we hiked from Mount Fløyen to Mount Ulriken. I've never hiked before, but this is one of the most incredible journeys I've ever taken.

We started off by taking a cable car from Bergen up to the top of the mountain.

We walked solidly for almost the entire day, and the views were simply unreal. Our plan was to walk for one our solid, before talking a rest. Each time we stopped, we would play a game of rock, paper, scissors to see who would be the water mule and carry the backpack.

Once we'd make it to the other mountain, we took a train through the mountains back down to Bergen. We stopped at McDonalds and stuffed outselves full of crap food.

That night, we ate at the fish market (once again, not good for vegetarians!).

## Day 5

The was the day where we travelled back to Oslo. We took a different route back from the one we'd taken on the way there. We made fewer stops this time, as we wanted to get back to Oslo at a reasonable hour.

Once place we did stop was called Flåm. Flåm is without a doubt the most beautiful place I have ever been in my life. It was so incredible beautiful, quiet and tranquil. I could have easilly spent the rest of my life there! Sadly we could not hang around, but we did stop for food and bask in the beauty.

Once back in Oslo, we booked a two hour floating sauna trip. The idea was to get super hot in the sauna, before jumping off the roof into the lake. This was a fantastic way to end the trip, and to relax our tired legs from the hike.

We ended the day with a burger from Max, before going to bed.

## Day 6

This is a boring day. We got up, checked out and went to the airport before flying home.

## After thoughts

I found Norway to be one of the most incredible places I've ever visited. In a way, it was too beautiful, as after several hours of unthinkably beautiful scenery, you're almost desensitised to it! The country is so open, green, quiet and vibrant.

There's loads more things we did that I have not covered, but we all had an amazing time.

The only downside I would say, is the cost. Norway is not a cheap place to visit!

I would absolutely love to do this trip again, however I think I would like to do a similar trip in another country. I've been to Sweden many times, so perhaps a road trip across Finland or Denmark is next.
