## A background on the cars

Ever since I could drive I’ve wanted to take my own car out on the track. Motorsport is an expensive hobby so the best I’d been able to do up until this point was a track experience day in my early 20s. Miles and I began speaking more seriously about it at the beginning of 2022, and in April, he commited and bought himself a Ginetta G40 as a track car. Almost immediately we had booked a track day at Thruxton, and began work preparing both our cars.

Miles' Ginetta was already fully set up for the track, but hadn’t ran in a while and was not road legal. It was missing headlights, a handbrake, fog lights and a bunch of other smaller items. We spent most weekends in April retrofitting all of these parts so we could get it MOT’d before the track day. We managed to get everything fitted, but were unable to get it through an MOT as the headlights were pointing straight at the sun and we ran out of time. 

I have a Ford Fiesta ST, which is a fairly good base for a track car, but requires some modifications. During April, we fitted lowering springs, an exhaust, engine mounts (all from Mountune), some EBC yellow brake pads, and some wheels and tyres from Pumaspeed. The car also has the Mountune MP215 kit. Besides these basic modifications, the car is completely stock and I use it as my daily driver.

## An early start

Check in was at 7:30, and we live around an hour away. As Miles' car was not on the road yet, he had to get it trailered.

We both met up shortly after 7:30 and checked in. We loitered around for a while, got some coffee and chatted with a few of the other drivers. At around 8:30 we all had to queue up and be noise tested. Miles went first, and took significantly longer than any of the other cars before him. As it turns out, he was 1-2 decibels below the noise limit and they said they’d keep an eye on him. All I got was a nod from the guy as he slapped a sticker on my windscreen so I guess mine was well below the limit.

## First steps

Miles’ fuel guage doesn’t work, so he went to top up just in case. I went out on the track for the very first time for the sighting laps. I was last on, and was way behind the pack. During the sighting laps you are limited to 60 mph and aren’t allowed to overtake. The idea is that you get a feel for the track and conditions, and ensure that your car is behaving itself. 

My immediate realisation was that I had absolutely no idea where I needed to be! I’ve played plenty of racing games over the years, but none of that practice helped here. I ended up sticking to the center of the track for the most part as I tried to survey the whole place. Even with the 60 mph limit I still fell way behind the pack and was on my own for the duration of the sighting laps.

Fortunately for me, I had paid for an hour of tution. When I returned from the sighting laps I headed over to the check in area and met the guy that would teach me all I need to know. Before we headed out there was a red flag, so we had to hang around for a while for that to be cleared. 

We headed out and did 5/6 laps, with the instructor constantly feeding me with information about where I should be, when to brake, when to accelerate, how to shift the weight of the car, how to pass others, and how to let others pass me. My confidence grew lap after lap and I could feel that on occasion, corners would be butter smooth. More often than not, I’d forget a step, hesitate, or try and feather the accelerator which would result in a slower or more unstable corner. When I got it right it was immediately obvious and it felt great!

We headed back to the pit lanes for a debreif and to let the car cool down. We headed out again and repeated a few times before the hour was up. 

I’d argue that that was the best £100 I’d ever spent, and I’d encourage everyone to seek the wisdom of an experienced driver on their first track day.

## Confidence building

As the day went on, both Miles and I got more and more confident being out on the track. We began to learn our limits and how to push them. Miles had never driven his car before (besides a failed trip to the MOT center). As the day went on and he got more familar with the car, his speed increased drastically. I’ve owned my car for a few years so I had an immediate advantage, helped even more by spending an hour with an actual racing driver. We took eacherother as passengers in eachothers cars and got a feel for what the other person was up against.

Using the advice from the instructor, I would head out for 6/7 laps, followed by a cooldown lap, before heading in to cool the car as my brakes began to fade. This patteren repeated for most of the day. Every time I headed out I would remember the landmarks that he showed me, and try and follow his advice as best as possible. At the beginning of the day we both quite nervous, but by lunch time that had been replaced with adrenaline fueled excitement.

## To race car, or not to race car

Both cars performed admirably for the entire day. They both likely did 40+ laps of Thruxton with no issues. My brakes were absolutely the limiting factor and would force me back in after 6 or 7 laps. Miles’ limitation was not his brakes, how much noise and heat he could withstand!

It’s very interesting to compare the two cars, as they are so very different. Some quick notes on our findings from them both:

The Ginetta:

- Absolutely mind blowing grip in the corners
- Incredible braking ability
- So loud it’s impossible for the two people to hear eachother
- Feels like sitting on the surface of the sun
- Runs out of steam at around 100 mph

The Fiesta:

- Surpisingly good in the corners, given it’s FWD with no diff
- Awful brakes in comparison
- A little loud, but almost like being in a Rolls Royce compared to the Ginetta
- Has air conditioning
- A complete monster on the long straights

There’s no doubt that the Ginetta is better suited to being on the track, but Thruxton actually favoured the Fiesta in some ways. Miles could domimate through the hairpin just before the pits, but the Fiesta had so much grunt from 60-120 that it could be making up (or even overtaking) the smaller cars such as the MX5x and Caterhams.

This is obviously only relevant to both our experiences, and the outcomes and findings would be completely different to experienced drivers.

I was worried at the beginning of the day that my car would be so slow that I would be a burden to the other drivers, but I was so imporessed with the way it performed. In fact, the only modifications I’m planning for the next track day are a half cage, drilled and groved brakes and some braided brake lines.

## End of the day

We finished our last session at around 16:30, by which point there were only 2 or 3 cars left out on the track. My brake pedal had the consistency of porridge and Rosie, Miles’ girlfiend had got a little car sick, a sign that Miles’s driving had improved substantially!

The truck arrived to collect the Ginetta and I headed off. When driving home I couldn’t help but be proud of my Fiesta. It had driven me to Thruxton, punched well above it’s weight all day, and then driven me home again. I’m struggling to the think of another car that could provide this much fun, perform so well and be so affordable.

Our first track had only finished 15 minutes earlier and I was already planning the next track day!

I was so proud of the car that I treated her to a wash this morning. I’ll be ordering some brake upgrades in the following weeks and I’ll be shopping around for a suitable roll cage.

Taking my car on the track was one of, if not the most fun I’ve ever done, although it’s opened a can of worms for the future! We’re both hoping to get another couple of track days in this year.

Until next time!
