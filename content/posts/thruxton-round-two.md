It only took two months from doing my first ever track day before I was out again. This time was a very different experience with some things being hugely more fun, and others making the day quite a challenge.

## Track Prep

After my previous day on track, I knew I had to do something about the brakes. I ended up fitting Mountune braided brake lines and replacing the fluid with some Motul race fluid. Fortunately I had the opportunity to use a ramp at a local garage, which made the whole job a lot easier. No bolts were rounded and the whole process took about 45 minutes. I already had EBC Yellow pads all round, so the only component left from the standard car is the factory Ford disks.

I also decided to fit a half cage. It isn’t a requirement for non soft-top cars, but I was quite concerned about rolling, even if the chance was very slim. There were quite a few options available but I ended up getting it from JP cages as the price was fair. I also installed a false floor as the car is still my daily driver. The cage was an absolute bitch to fit, and required removing all seats, the centre console, the gear selector and one of the doors. After struggling for an hour trying to navigate the cage through the door I ended up calling Miles who came and helped.

I also decided to fit a TurboSmart BOV, for no reason other than I wanted some turbo noise! Finally I replaced the engine oil and filter, and fitted a PumaSpeed short shifter. I ended up going with a genuine Ford filter, and Castrol Edge 5w30.

## The Squad

As it turns out, there were a bunch of people in our area that we knew that are also into doing track days, and we ended up with 4/5 cars in our group this time. We had a mixture of cars, including a DC5, a Civic Type R and a Golf GTI. We all know each other through friends, or friends-of-friends and all organised to go out on the same day.

## The Bloody Weather

I dreaded turning up for a track day and it be cold and raining, but what we ended up with was the polar opposite. It just so happened that we booked a track day on the hottest day in recorded history in the UK, with Thruxton itself being around 38 degrees. Other parts of the country hit 40+, so in some ways we got lucky.

Out of our group, only two cars had air conditioning, fortunately I was one of them!

The sessions were much shorter this time round, with the average amount of laps being around 3 or 4. We made sure to do proper cool down laps and let the cars cool properly between sessions.

The Fiesta performed really well even given the conditions, although it was absolutely clear that he intercooler just could not keep up with the heat. Every lap would make the car pull slower and slower out of the chicane until it felt like I had no turbo charger at all! 

The afternoon was really quiet, with only a few cars on the track at any one time, I guess so many people shouldn’t have deleted their AC!

Despite the heat I was still able to achieve lap times between 1:40-1:43 which is a pretty solid improvement on last time.

## What’s next

We’re already planning on heading back out in September and there’s a few things I’d like to do before then. Firstly I really need to get a better intercooler. I’m considering either a brand new one from RSport, or a second hand one from Mountune. I may even consider a sports cat, as I don’t think my standard cat is happy with the abuse on track. With those two modifications I would qualify for most of the “stage 2” maps that exist. If we keep going to Thruxton I think the extra 40 or so horsepower will be a huge addition.

Until next time!
