        <h3>Workray</h3>
        <p class="title">Full Stack Software Developer</p>
        <p>2016 - 2018</p>
        <p>I worked as a Full Stack Software Engineer within a small team of developers at Workray, a start up looking to change the job industry. I had been building Node.js micro services and developing a modern React front-end. Some of the API's I've worked on are used to power native apps. I've use Python for data manipulation, CLI scrips and AWS Lambda functions. Being such a small team, Ops and testing is everyones responsibility, as a result I've also been responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure. Working at Workray was an enjoyable challenge due the small team and fast delivery mentality.</p>

        <h3>Jobsite</h3>
        <p class="title">Software Developer</p>
        <p>2014 - 2016</p>
        <p>I was working as a Software Developer at Jobsite helping to create robust products in an agile/scrum environment. I primarily work on Node.js applications, creating scalable front end frameworks and high performance APIs using common frameworks and tools such as Express, Restify and Swagger. I helped the company convert from a single Perl monolith to a modern, micro-service platform. I also helped to maintain and improve the existing legacy code base which consists of Perl and Oracle DB.</p>
        <p>In a typical sprint I would likely work on either a Node, Perl or Python codebase, write system and unit tests for it, update or add automation tests, deploy the app within a Docker container and monitor logs to ensure it is functioning as expected.</p>

        <h3>Freelance</h3>
        <p class="title">Web Developer</p>
        <p>2010 - 2014</p>

        <p>I worked as a freelance designer after teaching myself HTML, CSS and Photoshop. I created static sites for customers and often worked on contract work for small agencies. This led me to want to pursue a career as a developer, so I taught myself Javascript and Python and went from there.</p>
