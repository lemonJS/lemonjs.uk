                <p><a href="https://hackerstash.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HackerStash</a> has a rather complicated system for calculating the score for the leaderboard as it includes the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sum of the votes for the project for this month (x10)</li>
                    <li>sum of the votes for the posts for this month (x5)</li>
                    <li>sum of the projects team members comments for this month (x1)</li>
                    <li>sum of the completed challenges for this month (xN)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In order to build the leaderboard, all this information must be known for every project. As you can imagine, this is a very expensive operation! Until recently I used to calculate this on the fly, then cache it in Redis for a few minutes so that subsequent queries were faster.</p>
                <p>This approach was a total hack and was not scalable. I was already seeing 1000ms response times with only ~30 projects on the leaderboard which is far too slow.</p>
                <p>After some research I decided on a Redis SortedSet as it seemed to fit the bill. I created a new class to handle the leaderboard that would be used for fetching the order of projects, as well as updating the project's score.</p>
                <p>The class looks a little something like this (simplified for your viewing pleaseure, of course):</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs python">
class Leaderboard:
  key: str = key()

  def __init__(self, project):
    self.project = project

  @classmethod    
  def order(cls, reverse=False) -> list[int]:
    order = redis.zrevrange(cls.key, 0, -1)
    return [int(x.decode('utf-8')) for x in order]

  @classmethod    
  def remaining_days(cls) -> str:
    return arrow.utcnow().ceil('month').humanize(only_distance=True)

  @property    
  def position(self) -> int:
    rank = redis.zrevrank(self.key, self.project.id)
    return rank + 1 if rank is not None else -1

  @property    
  def score(self) -> int:
    score = redis.zscore(self.key, self.project.id) or 0.0
    return int(score)

  def update(self, amount: int) -> int:
    score = redis.zincrby(self.key, amount, self.project.id)
    return int(score)
                </code></pre>
                <p>Let's break this down!</p>
                <p><code class="inline">Leaderboard#order</code></p>
                <p>This uses the Redis ZREVRANGE operation to get the project ids in reverse order using this months key. Redis stores the ids in a byte format, so they must be decoded into strings.</p>
                <p><code class="inline">Leaderboard#remaining_days</code></p>
                <p>I use a package called arrow (similar to moment.js for you Node folk) to tell us how long is left for this current tournament.</p>
                <p><code class="inline">Leaderboard#position</code></p>
                <p>I use the Redis ZREVRANK method to get an individual projects position. As the Set is 0 index based, I need to increment by 1.</p>
                <p><code class="inline">Leaderboard#score</code></p>
                <p>This uses the Redis ZSCORE method to get the current score for the project. It returns the score as a Float if it exists, or None if not. I cast to an Int as it would look a bit weird otherwise.</p>
                <p><code class="inline">Leaderboard#update</code></p>
                <p>This uses the Redis ZINCRBY method to increment the projects score. I call this whenever an action occurs like a vote, a simplified example looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs python">
def vote(self, direction: str) -> None:
  score = 5 if direction == 'up' else -5
  vote = Vote(type='post', score=score)
  Leaderboard(self.project).update(score)    
  db.session.commit()
                </code></pre>
                <p>When fetching the leaderboard, I can first get the order and use it to work out which projects to fetch from the database, like so:</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs python">
# Fetch the page from the query string, default to the first page
page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)

# Get a list of ids in their correct order from the above class
order = Leaderboard.order()

# Create an SQL expression using those orders
order_expr = func.array_position(order, Project.id)

# Get only the projects that qualify for the leaderboard, and order
# them based on the order expression
projects = Project.query\
  .filter(Project.id.in_(order))\
  .filter(Project.published == True)\
  .order_by(order_expr)\
  .paginate(page, 25, False)
                </code></pre>
                <p>Overall, some nice gains in performance and we're left with a more future proof solution</p>
                <p>I wrote about this over at <a href="https://hackerstash.com/posts/how-we-improved-the-leaderboard-load-times-by-8x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HackerStash</a>, you can check the speed gains out for yourself</p>
